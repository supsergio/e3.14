/*
 •• E3.14
 The following algorithm yields the season (Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter) for a given month and day.
 
 
 If month is 1, 2, or 3, season = "Winter"
 Else if month is 4, 5, or 6, season = "Spring"
 Else if month is 7, 8, or 9, season = "Summer"
 Else if month is 10, 11, or 12, season = "Fall"
 If month is divisible by 3 and day >= 21
 If season is "Winter", season = "Spring"
 Else if season is "Spring", season = "Summer"
 Else if season is "Summer", season = "Fall"
 Else season = "Winter"
 Write a program that prompts the user for a month and day and then prints the season, as determined by this algorithm.
